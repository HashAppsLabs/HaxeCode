          <h2>Why cross platform development?</h2>

<p>Variety of mobile platforms that take a share of the smartphones market. 
Less development time, team members, and cost. </p>

<hr />

<h2>Examples of cross platform tools:</h2>

<h3>Appcelerator Titanium:</h3>

<p>Is the most powerful platform tool available now.
About 450,000 developer, 50,000 application on stores, with 130 Million device running these application.
The bundle comes with the titanium SDK, titanium studio IDE, and appcelerator cloud services.
The key point is the support for native UI, although the applications core functionality runs on the javascript layer, which causes some low performance.</p>

<h3>Adobe AIR:</h3>

<p>AIR application runs on the most popular operating systems like iOS, android, Blackberry 10 and blackberry tablet OS, windows, linux, mac os using the air runtime developed by Adobe. 
The bundle comes with the Flash builder, and the AIR SDK.
No native UI, leads to leak of native experience of the device.
The application cycle goes as follow: the application talks to the runtime, the runtime talks to the system, the system responds to the runtime, and the runtime respond to the application. This cycle lead to poor performance. </p>

<h3>Phonegap:</h3>

<p>Phonegap applications runs on most available mobile OSs as it depends on the web layer of the mobile os. 
About 35,000 applications developed using mobile web technologies and HTML5.
No native UI.
Operating systems block the calls to system api’s from web components to prevent hacks.
Native portion of application is provided to call system api’s.  </p>

<h2>What is Haxe ?</h2>

<p>An open-source high-level multi platform programming language and compiler that can produce applications and source code for many different platforms from a single code-base.
Haxe can be compiled to several languages nowadays; as3, Java, C#, C++, js, php, and neko VM.
Object oriented modern language. More like adobe as3. 
A 3 hours crash course can get java, c#, c++, js, and php developers to know how to develop using haxe. 
Support for more languages in development.</p>

<hr />

<h2>What is Haxecode?</h2>

<p>It is a rapid development cross platform tool that help developers to write the applications once and run it natively everywhere.
Very lightweight framework, that leads to native performance on all targeted platforms.
Can target all platforms that use any language that haxe can be compiled to. 
Accordingly, haxecode can target almost all platforms available today. </p>
